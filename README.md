# Best-Practice-and-Guideline


## Branch

Create separate branch for configuration related to Interactor version
Example, if you created the solution using Interactor release 4.3.1
Create a branch called 4.3.1.
That way when your solution gets updated to later Interactor versioin, you also have configurations available for previous Interactors.
